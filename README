This was a final project for the first of two data mining courses at Tarleton State University.  The authors are Joseph Brown and Jon Stewart.  Many of the functions were written by others, including the plot.nnet function, passed to us by our professor.  The original author is unknown.

The report created can be found in the Tex folder, and is named "Final Report.pdf".

If one wishes to run the scripts again to generate the information and graphics used for the report, the best order to do this is, 

 - functions
 - start
 - arima models
 - Projections
 - Analyses
 - SVM

The code contributed by my partner, Jon Stewart, is best run in the order, 

 - corn yield project
 - ff corn yield neural network model
