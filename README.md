Predicting Crop Yields with Mutlivariate Autocorrelation
==========

Our goal is to use Multivariate Autocorrelation to make forcasts of field conditions.  The data comes from USDA databases on corn yields.  For each week in the season, farmers will report the conditions of their field with one of five categories.  We want to estimate the proportions of fields rated with each of those five categories.

## ARIMA

## Plots

For the five different field condition categories of the data set - Very Poor, Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent - there are four different plots in this folder.

category.png is a two-week forecast generated by the ARIMA models.

categorylag1.png is a one-week-ahead forecast for each week for the entire testing data set.  The black line follows the actual values from the data set, whereas the blue and red points mark a one-week forecast by an SVM model from the previous week.  Blue points are within the RMSE for the model, while the red points are not.  These models took into account not only the previous week, but the week before that in order to make these predictions.

categorylag2.png is like categorylag1.png.  It is also only a one-week-ahead forecast, however the models involved took into account the previous week along with the two weeks before that in order to make the predictions.

categoryyear15.png is a plot similar to categorylag1 and 2.png, however these resulted when one year was used as a test set, while the 14 other years were used to build the models.  These models used the week prior and the week prior to that for each of the predictions.

A notable example is goodlag1.png.  This shows the ability of an SVM model to capture the detail of the trends before they occur.
