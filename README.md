Predicting Crop Yields with Mutlivariate Autocorrelation
==========

Our goal is to use Mutlivariate Autocorrelation to make forcasts of field conditions.  The data comes from USDA databases on corn yields.  For each week in the season, farmers will report the conditions of their field with one of five categories.  We want to estimate the proportions of fields rated with each of those five categories.
